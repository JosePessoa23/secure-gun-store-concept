**Security Test Cases for US 03 (View the status of license application):**

1. **Authentication and Authorization:**
    - Ensure that the client can only view the status of their own application.
1. **Data Integrity:**
    - Test if the information shown to the client is correct.
1. **Error Handling:**
    - Induce errors during the status check process (e.g., a client without an application, request to see the status) and ensure that error messages are informative but do not reveal sensitive system details.
1. **Logging and Auditing:**
    - Confirm that the system logs all actions related to license process, including the client information, timestamp, and relevant message. This can be helpful for tracking and auditing purposes.
